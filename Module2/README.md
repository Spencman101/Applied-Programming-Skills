# Overview

During this project my goal was to showcase the skills that I have worked to gain in C++. 
Specifically I am was wanting a file that utilized many different functions/tactics to get a simple program completed.
Within the Grocery program a switchcase method is used to interate through a user selected menu choice.
The menu calls functions within other files to preform functions like calculating order totals, and make changes to the data file displayed to the user.
A vector is utilized to hold a user generated group of items and costs that are added from other functions utilizing setprecision() and cout tools.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

While developing this program I used Visual Studio Community, and the standard C++ library.
Specific features I used were fstream for operating files, iostream for inputs and outputs, as well as vectors to manage my cart list.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Add functions that would allow users to remove items from their cart.
- Implement code to save order history for customers, essentially a reciept function.
- Increase error handling for code impletemented.
